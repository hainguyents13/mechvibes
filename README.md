# MechvibesDX - The next version of Mechvibes


I've been working on **MechvibesDX** - a complete rewrite of Mechvibes with significant improvements to performance, compatibility, and user experience. You can check it out at the new repository: [mechvibes-dx](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes-dx)

## What's happening

-   **Current repo**: Will become legacy once MechvibesDX is stable
-   **New repo**: [mechvibes-dx](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes-dx) - active development
-   **Future**: When MechvibesDX reaches v1.0, it will become the main Mechvibes

## Major improvements in MechvibesDX

-   **Performance**: Completely rewritten audio engine for faster soundpack loading
-   **Audio Events**: Support for both keyboard (keydown/keyup) and mouse (button press/release) sounds with extended button support
-   **Size**: Significantly smaller application size with reduced memory footprint
-   **Settings**: Advanced settings page for fine-tuning audio, performance, and behavior options
-   **Compatibility**: Much better support for existing soundpacks from the community
-   **Soundpack Management**: Easy soundpack installation - import via modal or copy to folder and refresh, no app restart required
-   **Customization**: Modern UI design with extensive theming options, custom backgrounds, logo customization
-   **Organization**: Separate keyboard/mouse soundpack folders, better file
-   **Architecture**: Built with Rust and modern web technologies

## Try it out

# Mechvibes: A fun and practical way to bring your favorite keyboard sounds anywhere

> Mechvibes started as a side project I created for myself. Like many mechanical keyboard lovers, I faced challenges when using my keyboard in quiet environments - whether it was late at night or in the office. The loud, satisfying clicks might be music to my ears, but not so much for my parents or coworkers! If you’re in the same boat, Mechvibes is here for you.
